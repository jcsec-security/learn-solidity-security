# Solidity Security and Auditing Examples

Welcome to the Solidity Security and Auditing Examples repository! This collection contains a variety of practical examples and exercises that I use during my lectures on Solidity security and auditing. These resources are tailored for students who possess a 🌱 beginner 🌱 level of practical knowledge in the Solidity language and smart contract development. If you're ready to take the next step and delve into the realm of security, you're in the right place.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections:

### 🐛 Basic Examples 🐛

This section contains extremely simplified contracts, almost like code snippets, that highlight individual security issues. It's an excellent starting point for your journey. Read about each of the issues, and then dive into the code to identify the bugs. You can even challenge yourself by crafting your own Proof of Concept (PoC) solutions.

### 🐣 Exercises 🐣

In the "Exercises" section, you'll find slightly more advanced contracts that include some structure. While the majority of the code is redacted, these exercises simulate the appearance of real smart contracts. They're designed to give you a taste of what real-world contracts might look like and set you on your bug-hunting path.

### 💪 Faillapop Mock-Audit Environment 💪

When you feel ready to face the audit of a mock-protocol full of interesting vulnerabilities to hunt, head to Failapop (repo).
